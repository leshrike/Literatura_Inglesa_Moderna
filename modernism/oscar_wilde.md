## ENGLSIH MODERNISM

Just as authority has been undermined in religion
and morals, so too in morals. The old accepted standards
cannot satisfy a changing age... (Victorian standards)

The old fixed canons of taste have lost their validity...
the novelist ignores the earlier conventios of plot, vocabulary,
literary structure and orthodoxy of opinion...

The spirit of psychologica analysis... this is "modernism".

( R.A Scott-James, Modernsism and Romance )

Modernism is a manyfold term, implying several -sometimes even contradictory- elements and including different trends and **radical changes** -in literature,
art, philosophy, politics, economics, psychology and society.

The Modernism period in English Literature was first and foremost a reaction against the Victorian culture and aesthetic, wich had prevailed for most of the XIX century.

There was a **break of traditions** and intellectuals and artists at the turn of the century believed the previous generation's way of doing things was a cultural dead end.

The nineteenth century, like the several centuries before it, was a time of privilege for wealthy caucasian males. Women, minorities (ethnic), and the poor were marginalized to the point of utter silence.

The very essence of Modernism is **its International Character**; although its aesthetic roots can be found in **France** (Prous, Flaubert, Valery, Mallarme, Baudelaire -the French poet that was admired for the sophistication of their imagery ), Modernistm spread in many countries, mainly in **England** (T.S Elliot, V.Woolf, Richardson) and Ireland (James Joyce, Yeats) but also in other countries, like Germany (Munch, Thomas Mann), Poland (Kafka), Spain (Valle-Inclán, Ortega, Buñuel, Picasso)(estamos hablando de las Vanguardias), and  the United States (Erza Pound, W. Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, W.C Williams).

It is referred to the first quarter of the XXth Century, with writers such as Virginia Woolf, T.S Elliot, Katherine Mansfield, André Gide, Thomas Mann and James Joyce, but as the exact chronology there is not an unanimous response. Some modernist writers -who were all very aware of their modernity- tried to identify the crucial events around wich modernism started. Virginia Woolf argued that "on or about December 1910 human nature changed... all human relations shifted".

She mentioned that date maybe because it was the death of King Edward but also because it was the first **Post-Impressionist Exhibition** held in London, wich caused a great deal of interest -and anxiety.

For D.H Lawrence, modernism started in 1915, at the beginning of the WWI.

As a sociological phenomenon, modernism is connected to the Bohemian Paris of the 1920s, a kind of art
that was practiced by artists and writers who were outside the mainstream, outsiders, people who rejected conventional art and their institutions. ( THEY BECAME BASED )

Joyce exiled himself; (TOLD IRELAND TO FUCK ITSELF); LAWRENCE's social background was working-class (wich was exceptional); Virginia Woold, Dorothy Richardsoon, Katherine Mansfield... being woman writers,were outside of the conventional (masculine) order [TOLD MEN TO FUCK OFF OF THEIR BUSINESSES].
