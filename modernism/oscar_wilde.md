## ENGLSIH MODERNISM

Just as authority has been undermined in religion
and morals, so too in morals. The old accepted standards
cannot satisfy a changing age... (Victorian standards)

The old fixed canons of taste have lost their validity...
the novelist ignores the earlier conventios of plot, vocabulary,
literary structure and orthodoxy of opinion...

The spirit of psychologica analysis... this is "modernism".

( R.A Scott-James, Modernsism and Romance )

Modernism is a manyfold term, implying several -sometimes even contradictory- elements and including different trends and **radical changes** -in literature,
art, philosophy, politics, economics, psychology and society.

The Modernism period in English Literature was first and foremost a reaction against the Victorian culture and aesthetic, wich had prevailed for most of the XIX century.

There was a **break of traditions** and intellectuals and artists at the turn of the century believed the previous generation's way of doing things was a cultural dead end.

The nineteenth century, like the several centuries before it, was a time of privilege for wealthy caucasian males. Women, minorities (ethnic), and the poor were marginalized to the point of utter silence.

The very essence of Modernism is **its International Character**; although its aesthetic roots can be found in **France** (Prous, Flaubert, Valery, Mallarme, Baudelaire -the French poet that was admired for the sophistication of their imagery ), Modernistm spread in many countries, mainly in **England** (T.S Elliot, V.Woolf, Richardson) and Ireland (James Joyce, Yeats) but also in other countries, like Germany (Munch, Thomas Mann), Poland (Kafka), Spain (Valle-Inclán, Ortega, Buñuel, Picasso)(estamos hablando de las Vanguardias), and  the United States (Erza Pound, W. Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, W.C Williams).

It is referred to the first quarter of the XXth Century, with writers such as Virginia Woolf, T.S Elliot, Katherine Mansfield, André Gide, Thomas Mann and James Joyce, but as the exact chronology there is not an unanimous response. Some modernist writers -who were all very aware of their modernity- tried to identify the crucial events around wich modernism started. Virginia Woolf argued that "on or about December 1910 human nature changed... all human relations shifted".

She mentioned that date maybe because it was the death of King Edward but also because it was the first **Post-Impressionist Exhibition** held in London, wich caused a great deal of interest -and anxiety.

For D.H Lawrence, modernism started in 1915, at the beginning of the WWI.

As a sociological phenomenon, modernism is connected to the Bohemian Paris of the 1920s, a kind of art
that was practiced by artists and writers who were outside the mainstream, outsiders, people who rejected conventional art and their institutions. ( THEY BECAME BASED )

Joyce exiled himself; (TOLD IRELAND TO FUCK ITSELF); LAWRENCE's social background was working-class (wich was exceptional); Virginia Woold, Dorothy Richardsoon, Katherine Mansfield... being woman writers,were outside of the conventional (masculine) order [TOLD MEN TO FUCK OFF OF THEIR BUSINESSES].

How can we define modernism? according to Ray bradbury, Modernism is a self-conscious art with high aesthetic value usually non representational and non-mimetic. (It does not imitate reality, it is not a mimethic art).

It is an art that turns from a realistic point of view and humanistic representation to the problematics of language, style, technique, form in pursuit of a deeper meaning.

Art would not be a mirror to reality, but art will be focused on language (the way it is written, its style or its technique ). The main goal of these changes are the pursuit of the deeper penetration of life, to get a broader and deeper meaning of life.

An excelent philosopher, M. Foucault claims that we should envisage modernity rather as an attitude than as a period of history.

By attitude, he means a mode of relating or connecting to contemporary reality; a way of thinking and felling. (They needed a new approach to reality, in between of two wars)

this concept was similar to the concept of  "ethos", a Greek concept.

According to Faucaut, "Modernity is characterized by the conciousness of the discontinuity of time, a break with tradition, a feeling of novelty, of vertigo in the face of the passing moment(...)
Modernity is the attitude that makes it possible to grasp the "heroic" aspect of the present moment".

Having two world wars, moderns tried to embrace the "living in the moment" lifestyle, for example the verse "Make it new!" by Erza Pound.

THE MODERN MODEL

Has certain characteristics:

-  The breaking of Aristotelian Categories: 

Undermines the traditional conditions of the novel, like a well-defined plot, linear development and characterization, and **shifts from the realistic to the symbolic**. (From mimethic art to a )

1.- One modernist issue is the realization is the **SELF** (multiple self) does not exist as a unified entity; Lawrence, Woolf, Proust, Joyce **rejected the notion of a central self** on a fixed and stable identity, an idea of self that can be fully defined and fully analized.

The new focus of interest will not be on characters and facts, **but on the feelings and impressions** (wich claim no validity as facts). The main interest in the novelist novel will be shifted to our interior selves and the impressions that some events leave.

If there is   plot in modernist novels, it should be called a "psychological plot" -their point of view of interest being very likely in the dark places of the psychic. In this sense a prominent literary critic has defined modernism as "the spirit of psychological analysis".

This movement introduced a new form of narrating and writing a novel, one that would change fundamentaly change the essence of novel-writing. The "unreliable" narrator supplanted the omniscient narrator and readers were forced to question even the most basic assumptions about how the novel should operate.

-James Joyce's Ulysses is the prime example of a novel whose events are really the happenings of the mind, the goal of wich is to translate as well as possible the strange pathways of the human consciousness.

-This new emphasis of the inner life / inner mind entails a reduction of action in modernist novels: when we read them we often have the impression that little happens in them: actions and events never fully materialize and this absence of events reflects a contemporary sense of irony, a refusal to make the event the motivation of reading. (The authors were yearning for the interpretation of the reader, and creating an element that is considered high aesthetic value) (Lo más importante no es lo que se dice, sino cómo se dice).

Modenist fiction, then, is concened with conscienciousness and the **subconscious** (In portrait of the artist, stephen punishes himself through inner monologues). That is why this structure of external events of traditional fiction is diminished or presented in an oblique way. Instead, we have introspective analysis, reflection, allusions, evocation, suggestions and dreams. In consequence, the structure of time has to change, to adapt itself to the requirements of the new topics of interest.

The modernist writers usually present a stream of experience (" a stream of consciousness ") and the end is usually open and ambiguous: it does not provide a **final resolution**.

"This is just to say" is a case of a "Found Poem", it breaks the conventions of the poems.

" The red Wheelbarrow " (Carretilla roja) William Carlos Williams Probably an interpretation of the sun and its position on the sky.

 "Wire" by Paul Nash are modernist work of arts. His intention is to cause

"La fontaine" de Duchamp (a readymade sculpture) that is  meant to provide a new interpretation for the most common objects, according to Duchamp "everyday objects raised to the dignity of a work of art by the artist's act of choice."

Temporality of the modernist Novel: 

Narrative unavoidably has to deal with time, but in modernist literature time has to do again not with externall reality but rather with the fluctuations of the inner life. (It provides a more complex and unfocused experience, but more of a trip down to the main character's psyche)

It's a more creative notion of time, more appropiate to comprehend the complexity of modern experience, wich is less logical, more incoherent and fragmentary in our appreciations
of reality.

Before, for nineteenth-century novelists, time was the medium in wich people were growing or developing.

It was a logical time: it implied that individual lives make coherent sense. In modernist writing, however,
the "normal" temporality ( with beginning, middle and end ), is usually **frustrated**. 

Temporality is not a **linear**, progressive, entity but psychic, repetitive or cyclical: modernist writers substitute the logic of the traditional plot for the internal logic of metaphors, symbols and images.

Historical time is not completely absent, but it is combined with the time of subjectivity. What modernism does is to raise the notion not only of significant form but also of significant time, wich responds to the desire
to reappraise the operations of the mind. **This notion of temporality suggests the idea that contemporary experience resists coherent temporal order**. It also reflects the new preoccupations of the age: the importance of the psychic and the subconscious, wich is being underlined by Freud, Jung (Archetypes), Nietzsche or Kierkegaard among others. 


--------------------

Point of view:

If we take a look at contemporary thought, we can see how in the XXth century Western culture has moved away from dogma, certainty, fixity and all absolutes towards a 
cultural climate of relativism ( There is no truth, only points of view ). All our non-literary sources of knowledge (natural and social science and epistemology) have
led us to see truth, beauty (as a concept) and goodness as relatives. (With multiple interpretations)

As a result of this ambivalent mood (and complex), there is a shift in the narrative voice. In modernist fiction the author has not "disappeared" in absolute terms
(like in some postmodern narrative) but given himself/herself a fictional shape; he/she becomes one more character, therefore losing the authority traditionally granted to 
an omniscient god-like narrative voice.

Joyce's narrator in **Ulysses** is a good example of this: he is a **chameleon** (it will disguise itself), always adapting to the situation, concealing himself, so the narrative voice
becomes "a voice without an origin". The uqestions "who is speaking?" "whose voice is this?" cannot be easily answered. 

> In this case, it was Joyce's intention to confuse the reader.

Sometimes we even have a multiplication of narrators, wich is a new sign of the decline of "realism": as narrators are multiplied or made suspect, evidence becomes hearsay; 
empiricsm becomes relativism, facts become interpretations. Also typical of the modern novel is the exploitation of the unreliable witness wich is also an aspect of the author's **desire to make the
reader participate in the work**.
