>**The Stolen Bacillus and other Incidents(1895)**. 
Written by H.G wells (1866-1946)


Right at the end of the 19th century, a timeframe where the victorian conventions were broken.

The victorian period was from 1837 to 1901, the year when Queen Victoria died.

H.G Wells is one amongst others that created his major crafts in this time period.

He was a english writer, but was also considered as a futurist, essayist, historian, socialist, and a teacher.

- Socialism is a political theory, that rised at the end of the 19th century. Bad conditions for woman (protitution, working condition).

- Anarchism is a political movement is important for Wells.

> His most known novel is **"The war of the Worlds"** was released in 1898. But he is also the author of **"The time Machine"** (1985), that was a parody of the English class division. He also wrote one of the moder  science fiction stories, and  **"The Invisible Man"** (1897). All those novels were way ahead of their time, breaking **literary conventions**.

Realism was the common thing to read and to write in the Victorian period, this genre reflected the reality or portrayed it as is. Autors such as Charles Dickens created "realistic" novels such as **"Oliver Twist"**, **"Great Expectations"** or **"Hard times"** and many others.

Many considered Wells to have a incredible imagination, and he thought that other worlds could be created and another lives coud be lived. Creating then the **"Science fiction"** genre.

>Wells, with his greatly known imagination, was one of the **precursors/pioneers of Science fiction**, along with Jules Verne (1828-1905) with **"Journey to the center of the Earth"** (1864).

As a socialist, Wells asked for the **'abolition of class barriers'**, but also **'free competition between individuals in society' regardless of their social backgrounds'**.

Wells feels like England needed a new type of society, he used to imagine a different world, this thoughts generated his creation **"A modern Utopia"(1905)**. He proposes the equality of the sexes, and regardless of social status. On top of that, he suggests a highly regulated world state all property is owned by the state.

In his own utopia he was very modern, adopting values that would appear in the future, where neither sex or social status mattered.

> "Man is the unnatural animal, the rebel child of nature, and more and more does he turn himself against the harsh and fitfulhand that reared him".
H. G. Wells, A modern Utopia (1905)

He considered that the political form that was implicit in modern science was a Socialist World State.
>"A gret world order that foreshadowed by scientific an industrial progress".
H. G. Wells

The Victorian Empire (Victorian Period 1830-1900) was the biggest empire to date, where queen Victoria had posession over a half of the globe.Queen victoria was the empress of India as well.

In the 1870 started a decay of Victorian values, where the US start to become a rival power. Due to economic depression, many start to immigrate. In this time period Socialism started to gain strength.


**Educational opportunities**

First woman's college established in London 1848. By the end of Victoria's reign, women could take degrees at 12 university colleges.

At the end of the victorian period, women had terrible working conditions, driving them into prostitution.

>This was portrayed in **"Ms. Warren profession"** writen by George Bernard Shaw.

Prostitution was the only ocupation wich an unmarried middle-class woman could earn a living and maintain some claim to gentility was that of a governess.

A Governess used to teach math, singing, Latin, music, handcrafting, sewing, (bordar) and household... and they were called "Acomplishments".Those Acomplishments were intended to hone the capacity of woman to become a proficient **"Angel of the house"**.

>When refering to **Angel in the House**, people expected woman to **keep the house as a space of peace and tranquility** where man could refuge from the problems of society.

## THE WOMAN QUESTION (Debate de la mujer, sufragistas)

The woman question was a discussion that was held in the 19th century(1832 - 1867), where new regulations were discussed about the nature of woman. 

Those new regulations would include:
```
- Changing the conditions of woman's work (due to Industrial revolution)

- The factory acts (1802-78)

- The custody Act (1839) gave a mother the right to petition the court for access to her minor children and their custody  under seven and later sixteen.

- Married Women's Property acts (1882)

- The divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act (1857) - established a civil divorce court. 
```
>For context: **In spain people could not get divorced until 1981**.


Woman in england did not get the right to vote until 1918, petitions advocating for women's suffrage were introduced as early as 1840s. Equally important was the agitation to allowmarried woman to own and handle their own property.
This culminated in the passing of.

The industrial revolution resulted in changes for woman. In horrible work conditions. This revolution presented a challenge to traditional ideas of woman's place.

> H. G. Wells was a supporter of woman, he believed that woman should leave the domestic sphere.

Woman wanted to be in the political agenda and to become more public.

But During the victorian period, woman were expected to create a place of peace and tranquility where a man could take refuge from the difficulties of modern life.

>Wells engaged with other key struggles such as the campaign for female struggle portrayed in Anna Veronica (1909).

The film director Orson Wells, of the night of Halloween in 1948, (40 years after the release of **"The War of the Worlds"**), with the on-air radio broadcast of the novel caused widespread panic in NY.
