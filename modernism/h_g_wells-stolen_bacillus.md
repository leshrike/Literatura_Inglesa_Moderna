# H. G. Wells -- Modernism

>**The Stolen Bacillus and other Incidents(1895)**. 
Written by H.G wells (1866-1946)


Right at the end of the 19th century, a timeframe where the victorian conventions were broken.

The victorian period was from 1837 to 1901, the year when Queen Victoria died.

H.G Wells is one amongst others that created his major crafts in this time period.

He was a english writer, but was also considered as a futurist, essayist, historian, socialist, and a teacher.

- Socialism is a political theory, that rised at the end of the 19th century. Bad conditions for woman (protitution, working condition).

- Anarchism is a political movement is important for Wells.

> His most known novel is **"The war of the Worlds"** was released in 1898. But he is also the author of **"The time Machine"** (1985), that was a parody of the English class division. He also wrote one of the moder  science fiction stories, and  **"The Invisible Man"** (1897). All those novels were way ahead of their time, breaking **literary conventions**.

Realism was the common thing to read and to write in the Victorian period, this genre reflected the reality or portrayed it as is. Autors such as Charles Dickens created "realistic" novels such as **"Oliver Twist"**, **"Great Expectations"** or **"Hard times"** and many others.

Many considered Wells to have a incredible imagination, and he thought that other worlds could be created and another lives coud be lived. Creating then the **"Science fiction"** genre.

>Wells, with his greatly known imagination, was one of the **precursors/pioneers of Science fiction**, along with Jules Verne (1828-1905) with **"Journey to the center of the Earth"** (1864).

As a socialist, Wells asked for the **'abolition of class barriers'**, but also **'free competition between individuals in society' regardless of their social backgrounds'**.

Wells feels like England needed a new type of society, he used to imagine a different world, this thoughts generated his creation **"A modern Utopia"(1905)**. He proposes the equality of the sexes, and regardless of social status. On top of that, he suggests a highly regulated world state all property is owned by the state.

In his own utopia he was very modern, adopting values that would appear in the future, where neither sex or social status mattered.

> "Man is the unnatural animal, the rebel child of nature, and more and more does he turn himself against the harsh and fitfulhand that reared him".
H. G. Wells, A modern Utopia (1905)

He considered that the political form that was implicit in modern science was a Socialist World State.
>"A gret world order that foreshadowed by scientific an industrial progress".
H. G. Wells

The Victorian Empire (Victorian Period 1830-1900) was the biggest empire to date, where queen Victoria had posession over a half of the globe.Queen victoria was the empress of India as well.

In the 1870 started a decay of Victorian values, where the US start to become a rival power. Due to economic depression, many start to immigrate. In this time period Socialism started to gain strength.


**Educational opportunities**

First woman's college established in London 1848. By the end of Victoria's reign, women could take degrees at 12 university colleges.

At the end of the victorian period, women had terrible working conditions, driving them into prostitution.

>This was portrayed in **"Ms. Warren profession"** writen by George Bernard Shaw.

Prostitution was the only ocupation wich an unmarried middle-class woman could earn a living and maintain some claim to gentility was that of a governess.

A Governess used to teach math, singing, Latin, music, handcrafting, sewing, (bordar) and household... and they were called "Acomplishments".Those Acomplishments were intended to hone the capacity of woman to become a proficient **"Angel of the house"**.

>When refering to **Angel in the House**, people expected woman to **keep the house as a space of peace and tranquility** where man could refuge from the problems of society.

## THE WOMAN QUESTION (Debate de la mujer, sufragistas)

The woman question was a discussion that was held in the 19th century(1832 - 1867), where new regulations were discussed about the nature of woman. 

Those new regulations would include:
```
- Changing the conditions of woman's work (due to Industrial revolution)

- The factory acts (1802-78)

- The custody Act (1839) gave a mother the right to petition the court for access to her minor children and their custody  under seven and later sixteen.

- Married Women's Property acts (1882)

- The divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act (1857) - established a civil divorce court. 
```
>For context: **In spain people could not get divorced until 1981**.


Woman in england did not get the right to vote until 1918, petitions advocating for women's suffrage were introduced as early as 1840s. Equally important was the agitation to allowmarried woman to own and handle their own property.
This culminated in the passing of.

The industrial revolution resulted in changes for woman. In horrible work conditions. This revolution presented a challenge to traditional ideas of woman's place.

> H. G. Wells was a supporter of woman, he believed that woman should leave the domestic sphere.

Woman wanted to be in the political agenda and to become more public.

But During the victorian period, woman were expected to create a place of peace and tranquility where a man could take refuge from the difficulties of modern life.

>Wells engaged with other key struggles such as the campaign for female struggle portrayed in Anna Veronica (1909).

## War of the Worlds and Science fiction

The film director Orson Wells, of the night of Halloween in 1948, (40 years after the release of **"The War of the Worlds"**), with the on-air radio broadcast of the novel caused widespread panic in NY.

> **Many flee homes to escape 'Gas raid' from mars.**

## Political persona

Wells was a politically active person, he believed that a new and better form of ruling was based on socialsim, at the end of the 19th century and the beginnig of the 20th century. He was amongst the ranks of the Fabian society, he thought that socialism as a political theory was necesary in the UK in the end of the 19th century.

He proposed socialsim, but also believed that the Society was a "talking shop for middle-class socialsts". The proposals made by the Fabian Society were not radical enough and considered the Fabian societiy as naïve, as they did not pursue a radical change.

When in 1908 his proposal for "the payment of mothers" was rejected by **the Fabian society**, he resigned from the organisation, for being not radical enough.

>**The fabian society would later turn into the "Labor Party" (Partido laborista Britanico).** 
> **Payment of mothers** -> Salary attributed to a (stay-at-home mother) mother.


>During the Second World war H.G Wells, he drafted a **"Universal Rights of man"** that was published in a letter to the Times. This document helped a lot to develop the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** in 1948.

He was compromised writing fiction, he wrote a lot of socialist-based texts as well **"Universal rights of men"**, wich was published in a letter to the Times.

>**HG Wells, is modern and could considered by many as a humanistic.**

>Humankind -> Especie humana.

### What is to be a Humanist

>Humanist -> Font (americanHumanist.org)

Humanist according to **"The humanist Magazine"**
Humanism is a rational philosophy informed by science, inspired by art, and motivated by compassion. It advocates the extension of participatory democracy and the expansion of the open society, standing for human rights and social justice.


Humanist(Humanism) according to **"Humanism Society of Western New York"**
Humanism is: A joyous alternative to religions that believe in a supernatural god and life in a hereafter. Humanists believe that this is the only life of which we have certain knowledge and that we owe it to ourselves and others to make it the best life possible for ourselves and all with whom we share this fragile planet


According to **Steven Schafersman** 
Humanists affirm that humans have the freedom to give meaning, value, and purpose to their lives by their own independent thought, free inquiry, and responsible, creative activity. Humanists stand for the building of a more humane, just, compassionate, and democratic society using a pragmatic ethics based on human reason, experience, and reliable knowledge-an ethics that judges the consequences of human actions by the well-being of all life on Earth.


Humanism **(verywellmind.com)**
Humanism stresses the importance of human values and dignity. It proposes that people can resolve problems through the use of science and reason. Rather than looking to religious traditions, humanism instead focuses on helping people live well, achieve personal growth, and make the world a better place.

## HG Wells and Science

HG Wells was a man of science as well, and began studying biology and Darwinism under Thomas Henry Huxley, Adolus Huxley's Grand father, who wrote Brave World.

Darwinism (Species Evolution Theory).

HG Wells wrote The Island of Doctor Moreau (1986), another of Wells's many stories to inspire movie adaptatios, deals with themes of eugenisc (the ethics of scientific experimentation), Darwin's theories and religion.

>**Eugenistic : "is it really ethical to expermient with humans?"**

When being a part in the socialist Fabian Society and met playwright (dramaturgo) George Bernard Shaw.

The bacteriologist who recieves a visit in his laboratory. This man is a stranger and a foreginer but the scientist shows him the chollera bacillus and they talk about the disease. The scientist describes the power of this bacillus, the power of science, as a powerful force that could cause terrible consequences: an epidemic could be caused by the water of London.

The visitor leaves and then the scientit notices the vial of bacteria missing and he follows the strange man to the london city center where the man plans to release the bacillus into the water supply.

>**Why is this his main motivation?**
The anarchist wants to show the world the power of the scientific evolution and **his own power**, wich could damage a huge part of the population, and obtain **fame** in the process. This is a case of **Bio-Terrorism**.

In the stolen bacilus, the author mocks the anarchists, and he mocks the scientific experimentations.

Stollen Bacillus asked Victorian readers to consider what kind of people ar responsible for containing these newly 
discovered life forms. Wells himself was a late-Victorian figure. 

He is trying to criticise science as well as the responsibles for the scientific experimentations.

It is important to note that the Anarchist is from an eastern country. This shows the anxiety/fear population was feeling at the end of the century (fin de siècle): the foreginer is "pale" and posessess a "limp white hand".

This story conflates(combinar, mezclar) political, biological and foreign threats to social order, suggests that British technological developments are pehaps becoming as much a danger for the safety of the empire.

>Stollen Bacillus was not noticed because of its publishment between The time machine and The Island of Docotr Moreau, casted Stollen Bacillus into the shadows, acording to Hashimoto (2003Hashimoto)

His story deserved to be more relevant because of its interest in eliminating the social order attempting to use reent scientific discoveries for murderous purposes. 

Whereas 19th developments in chemistry paved the way for the use of poisonous gases during the WWI, the use of biological agents had to wait until the 1930s.  


If we compare the 19th centutry's Anarchists, to the today's terrorists, we can see that we tick many boxes. The  posibility of chaos using science as weapon is more likely nowadays.

Wells'  story remains interesting because it considers that scientific discoveries may prove to be lethal and not only in with the objective of helping humankind. It also shows the need for reflection on how societis view groups thet imposes their values with malitious intent.

# Anarchists

Anarchists in the 19th century could be compared to the Terrorists nowadays.



Schollars generally divide the history science fiction in two genres, before 1900, and after 1900.

##Before 1900:
>Science Fiction before 1900 -> Imagination Discovers Technology by Paul K Alkon

What are the limits of science? Should it have one? Who is responsible for it? The Government? Humans?

Diseases could be carried around without killing, and then released.

Science fiction excels at articulating the new posibilities surounding technology, technology being the widest meaning of science applied.

The chosen ones amongst the Science fiction were:

- **Frankenstein** by Mary Shelly
- **Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea** by Jules Verne.
- **The Time Machine** by H.G Wells.
- **The War of the worlds** by H.G Wells.
- **Utopia** by Sir Thomas More


##After 1900:
