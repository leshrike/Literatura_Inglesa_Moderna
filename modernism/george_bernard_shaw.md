# George Bernard Shaw

Irish playwright and critic, that uses irony and satire to get his audience's attention. (Begining of XX century end of IXX )

He tackles some controverisal topics / concerns in his creations (Pygmallion, arms and the man, Major Barbara) such as:

* Social classes



* War


* Gender Issues (Feminism) -- (At that time) The woman's question

    - He was a supporter on enabling woman to vote (woman's suffrage)


Shaw developed an intellectual **comedy of manners** (more sophisticated), *Ms Warren's profession* is a good example of this.

Like Oscar Wilde, Shaw wrote about the **hypocresy surrounding the english society** (Victorian).

Shaw left Ireland for England as a young man in 1876 and he started writing novels and criticism before turning to the theater.

This writer has inspired countless authors and poets and he became one of the most well-known playwrights of his time. His resources were **wit and irony.**

He wrote fifty plays, many of wich are still in production today.

He also was a brilliant photographer, social repormer, women's rights advocate, satirist, popular public speaker among many other things.

# Shaw's view on Education

Education was a concern for shaw as well.

He understood that *Liberty* was the breath of life to nations. 

On top of that, he thought that liberty should be the main point of the children's learning process.

Shaw considered that working was incredibly boring... he wanted to be an artist!

Noticed the huge disparity among the social classes, and took inspiration as an artist from William Blake and Lord Byron.

## Shaw's view on Politics

During his lifetime and well past it, he received numerous critics about his political views. His *humanitarian politics* would rise controversial and contradictory opinions.

> Shaw rejected completly the revolutions, despite being a Socialist.

Shaw was a member of the Fabian society, a socialist revolutionary group wich main objective was to protect the interests of the poorer classes against what they perceived to be an exploitative, capitalist society. 

>His political views led him to build **The Independet Labour Party** in 1893.

>In 1895, he was one of the founders of the **London School of Economics an Political Science**.

He is and was considered an **activist**, an ardent supporter of many social reforms and campaigns that tackled themes such as the woman's rights or the abolition of private property.

## Shaw's creations

His plays were created in order to shock his audience and stir the conscientiousness of the viewers. This was done in order to teach new social and moral values.

He used paradox, his wit, and reversed the common patterns of judgement.

> Could be Mrs. Warren be the heroine in the play? (Mrs. Warren's profession)

All the works of Shaw, contained a socio-political dimension.

>*Pygmalion* (1913), for example, exposes the class divisions of British society. Combines comedy and social observation.

## Shaw's support with "The Woman's Question"

Shaw was a supporter of the WSPU "Women's Social and Political Union".

### The Suffragists and Suffragettes

The members of this movement, the "suffragettes" (different from suffragists), were outspoken and some employed violent tactics.

> The suffragettes were not welcome anywhere. They would be considered as mad.

The Pankhurst took an important role in the militant campaign for the vote.

In 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst and others frustrated by the lack of progress, founded the WSPU with the motto "Deeds not Words".

This movement started in 1832, but the petitions were not heard until way later.

They wanted to be lawmakers, not lawbreakers.

#### Emmeline Pankhurst

Ms. Pankhurst (1858-1928) became involved in woman's suffrage in 1880. She was a founding member in 1903 (in Manchester) and led it until it was disbanded in 1918. Under her leadership the WSPU (Women's Social and Political Union) was a highly organised group. She was imprisoned and went of hunger strike protests for the cause.

The pankhurst were a middle-class, who had time and money to spend in the future campaigns.

#### The WSPU

The membership of the WSPU was limited to woman only.

The members were determined to obtain the right to vote for women by any means.

* They campaigned tireslessly and sometimes violently
* More radical approach was needed

The members of WSPU were seen as bossy and considered as a threat.

**ASSIGNMENT**



The most relevant social protests and a meme of this movement:

    The MeToo movement: opportunity for woman to speak about the abuses that may have been sexually assaulted or sexually harassed.

    The BLM: Black lives matter.

### Important ideas in Shaw's writing

* **MARRIAGE:**

He considered the service is to make the best of a commercial contract of property and slavery by subjecting it to some religious restraint by elevating it by some touch of poetry.

The actual result is that the two people bounded by that contract will remain in that excited condition constantily until death do them apart.

### Mrs Warren's Profesion

In an apology in the introduction of "Ms warren's profession", Shaw states the importance of tackling the problems portrayed in that text is very important for
the social development of england.

The play was forbidden and censored to perform on public stage due to controversial themes such as incest and prostitution. (This play was considered inmoral in the Victorian England).

However, the play was seen as an exposure of the hyporcrisy of the Victorian morality and it showed how the capitalist society of the 19th century pushed woman into prostitution and gender inequality.

He states "Mrs Warren is much worse than a prostitute, as she is an organsim of prostitution - she manages brothels in every big city in Europe - and she is proud of it".

Vivi is highly educated and lives a comfortable life, but she is not aware of the nature of the income. The drama comes from the discovery of the fact. The consequences were quite sensible and no crime is commited, but the main point is to appeal to the audience.

His intention was to make the audience feel uncomfortable. The play has horrified everyone who has head it but only as a hones treatment of the topics at hand.  

Vivie was the image of the concept **New Woman** in the 1880, and he explained that he wanted to put on the stage for the first time , the highly educated, capable and independent young woman. 
This "New Woman" concept, was related to prefering the society of men to the woman, and being a person who does not care about romance or art,  and who can become respectabe through sheer usefuless & strength.

Miss warren represents the "New Woman" model, a woman who was interested in her education, personal dignity, growth, and who is not interested in the traditional idea of having a husband or children.

Vivie's high education and morals, the conflict soon arises and ends their relationship as mother and daughter. Another result of Vivie's schooling and upbringin is when she becomes aware of how women are held back in society from attaining fame and fortune.

Shaw wants to stress the dificult nature of the relationship between mother and daughter.

The ideal of the victorian motherhood was "the angel in the house", was a virtuous wife and mother in need of male protection provided by a husband or father. Her entire purpose as to devote herself to the household and the family within the domestic sphere."Woman were owned by their husbands". Their house were their place to be, inside, not in the public sphere (they were forbidden to be in public).

Married women could not own property in their own names or keep their earnings (instead it belonged to their husbands). Women could not vote.

At the end of the XIX century, there were a few reforms. The Married Women's Property Act of 1882 allowed woman to keep their earnings and hold property in their own names.

Later, at the beginning of the 20th Century the NEW WOMAN represented a young, well-educated who rejected the restrictions on dress, behaviour, education or decorum placed on women by Victorian society/culture.

Woman started to attend universities in 1869 they were the first admitted to Cambridge to study although they were not allowed to take degrees. By 1902 there were over 200 doctors in England and in 1895 the first woman qualified as a dentist.

As the suffrage movement gained greater influence a new model of femininity developed: The new woman. Wich wholly embodied feminist aspirations at the turn-of-the-century.

Cooley's 1904 "The new Womanhood" presents an ideal description of this new identity:

" The finest archievement of the new woman has been personal liberty.. the new woman in the sense of the best woman, the flower of all the womanhood of past ages, has come to stay - if civilization is to endure.
The sufferings of the past have strenghtened her, maternity has deepened her, education is broadening her - and she knows that she must perfect herself if she would perfect hte race and leave her imprint upon immortality, though her offspring or her works. " (On the role of maternatory)

Cooley's celbratory vision emphasizes the ability of modern women to pursue a dual existence within public and private spheres.

Mrs Warren profession is a defense of women and a condemnation of Capitalism as a whole. Crofts, for example, gets benefits from Capitalism, while the poor, like Mrs Warren, must trade dignity and morality success.


SHAW stated about his first plays "My three first plays Widower's Houses, The philanderer, and Mrs Warren's proffession were what people call realistic".They were dramatic pictures of middle class society from the point of view of a socialist who regards the basis of that society as thoroghly rotten economically and morally. And he also states regarding Mrs Warren's profession:

" I am convinced that fine art is the most seductive, the most effective means of moral propagandism of in the world " - Bernard SHAW (a modo de propagar la existencia de los dilemas morales contemporales).


****** STUDY QUESTION

1.- Theme: confronting the truth: Reaction? Discovery? Keeping secrets?

1.- Mrs. warren's profession was first published in 1898 ....
 
In the "Preface" to the first "Umpleasant", volume of this collection, shaw states that "I must .. warn my readers that my attacks are disrected against themselves, not against my stage figures"
Mrs Warren's profession stands as a condemnsation of socciety at large, with several of its characters portrayed with  negative connotations. Who are they?
Cite and analyze a few passages that seem to do this (Suggestion: you might start by considering how the middle-class is represented in this play. Which characters are the most middle-class?)


2.- The stage directions in this play are long and detailed. What is the effect of such long descriptions ? What do they suggest about this play? Analyze one of the long stage directions: what does it contribute to the meaning of the play? (Use a stage direction that is at least four lines long, do not use the long scene-setting passages that begin each act. Stage directions that describe gestures-rather than only dress and appearence- will be more fruitful).
 



3.- In the sense that she is the central character, and the one who moves most strikingly from ignorance to knowledge, Vivian Warren is the heroine of Mrs Warren's Profession. Does the play vindicate her actions at the end of the play? If not, is there some other character whose actions are vindicated? In other words, who is doing the right thing, according to the play? Cite a few passages.




4.- Near the end of the play, Praed, an architect, tells Vivie Warren to travel to Italy "to saturate" herself with beauty and romance. Is this what Vivie really needs at this moment? Why or why not?
Remember to justify your answe in terms of the play not your own feelings about what is best for Vivie.
