### My own dreams

Dreams such as **"Expressing freely"** or being able to **"acces all the information available on a specific topic"** in order to form an opinion and rise your voice and to be listened to no matter who you are.

The dreams above are not fulfilled yet, but the quote of Blake is accurate in our timeframe, because we believe in what we are exposed to.

In news from nowhere, morris imagines a new world concept.

He is concerned by many subjects such as education (as we can see in chapters V or X)


Utopia is a place or government that we imagine, wich has social and political perfection. This place is reached in the material world as opposed to some spiritual afterlife.

The characers of such utopias are tipically clean as clean, virtuous, healthy and happy. This society is proven to have cured all social ills.

---

Utopian literature is a genre for any text that presents the reader with the idea ofa perfect society in the physical world, as opposed to the one presented by the religion in the afterlife (such as the Valhalla or Heaven ). 

Some critics establish that the first literary Utopia was Plato's ideal commonwealth in the Republic (400 BCE)l, in wich a group of philosophers seeked to define justice and end up as a nebtal exercise a hypothetical perfect polis, self-governing city of about 8000 citizens.

---

In this utopian society, philosophers are the rulers, but goods and women are communally  owned and slavery is taken for granted. Artists, actors and poets are largely exiled.

Sir More's Utopia opened the genre in 1516 and his name for the imaginary kingdom became the term used in reference to othe genre more generally.
>Great examples of this genre are **News from nowhere** by William morris and **A modern Utopia** by H.G Wells

> **News from Nowhere** by William morris (1890) tells a story of an Englishman that wakes up to find himself in a post-revolutionary and post-industrial 21st Century England.

The author imagines how the world is going to be in the 21st century, after revolutions and the industrialization.

The new and ideal country is organized on an ideal communism with no money, no private property, and equality. Labour is shared equally and is considered a pleasure rather than a necessary tool.
Industrialism gets rejected and it now we favour low-tech crafts.

The main character is called "Guest", who learns that:

- Money has disappeared**
- Craftwork has pushed aside 'wage slavery'
- Contracts of marriage have ben replaced by flexible bonds of affection.
- Parliamentary democracy has given way to informal patterns of co-operation.

## Hope VS Despair

In general, humans tend to fall too quickly from hope and idealism to despair and cynism, a fall that signals our transition from innocence to death. The cynical attitude is the resort of those who are too lazy to struggle for more growth. Some studies regarding the critical approach to News From Nowhere state that this work would provid the antidote; it would inspire us to strive towards the restoration of paradise.

Morris' generation responded to the pessimism of the age by embracing art over religion.

He advocates that we all must live our lives as artists. This is the final conclusion by Morris's dreamer at the end of News from Nowhere. At the end, the dreamer believes that **art is all we need** in order to be happy, not religion or technology.

> Religion **stopped** responding to some of their needs and questions, so **they embraced art**.

> **Art for the art's sake** is a posture that many held during this timeframe.


> **"If others have seen it as I have seen it, then it may be called a vision rather than a dream"** William Morris, News from Nowhere.

If a comunity shares a dream it may become a vision.

## The nature of Change & Hope

What is hope? And change? Are dreams beliavable? What are the nature of our dreams?

This writer envisioned transformations, wich could be considered as naïve, incredible or impossible to realize:

- **The idea of fellowship replacing self-interest**. Using the principal of self-sacrifice for  the grater good over the self-assertion.
    - Could the communal values of socialism may turn to a mass movement like a worldwide religion?

- **Who can believe that healthy, beautiful people will replace our corrupt social order?**
    - ¿Was the Pandemic as a dystopia?
    
- **That the sunshine will change our dreary weather?** - Naïve question

- **That clean fish will renew our polluted rivers?**

- **That good people will enjoy working without the rewards that distinguish workers from loafers?**

- **What would it be like to live in heaven, to live a heavenly life on earth?**

--- 

##  Visions

>The **suffragist movement** was considered a vision, wich generated from the dream of a person.

## Results of the text

The autor challenges the reader to consider this as a practical question that every responsible adult should pursue rather than dismiss as a childish dream.

>**The elimination of polution, a world at peace and the elimination of class divisions** are a few examples of the utopical ideals that may be deemed as a childish dream.

News from nowhere is a revolutionary response to the fundamental question about the
way we live our lives.

The **subtext** of Morris' narrative romance is not so much whether or not a heavenly utopia could ever become a reality.

Morris is horrified that we no longer even wish for it to happen.

## How I became a Socialist?

In a lecture on 'How i became a Socialst', morris explains how the capitalist system has 'reduced the workman to such a skinny and painful existance, that scarcely knows how to frame a desire for any life much better'

He finds that art provides the answer "It is the province of art to set the true idea of   full and reasonable life before him, a life to wich the perception and creation of beauty the enjoyment of real pleasurse that is shallbe felt to be as necessary as daily bread."

The first and last chapters of NFNwhere frame the desire for this utopian ideal as the narrator's friend repeats his anxious wish to envision what would happen on the Morrrow of hte Revolution: 'If I could but see a day of it'; id could but see it"
By the last chapter, his despair has turned into an affirmation of hope: 'Yes, surely! and if others can see it as I have seen it then it may be called a vision rather than a dream'.

## Transformation / changes

The transformation is achieved through a complex dream-vision where the reader is unsure who is sepaking from the beginning through the end

Morris uses multiple levels of narrative as part of his utopian strategy: the story of this dream-vision is a story to be passed form friend to friend, each spreading the word from one to another, as an apostole spreading the Word of the Bible, a socialist bible for the Morrow of new world-order. Dream-visions were a popular Medieval convention for story-telling, but morris uses his drea-vision by providing psychological explanations for such supernatural elements.

This text is not considered as a escapist utopian fantasy, but a political act. The opening lines are a reference to the debate about Anarchism that took place in the Socialist League in 1889 and 1890.

## The Socialist League

The Socialist League was one of several **early socialsit groups** wich arose in Great briain in the 1880.

It was an eclectic group of people (socialists and anarchists) who **focused on education and outreach** as the most effective means of social change.

In his four or five years of great activity, this League sponsored thousands of lectures, open-air meetings and other educational efforts.

It distribued a lot of socialist literature, such as leaflets, books or newspapers, whose audience reache well into the next century.
