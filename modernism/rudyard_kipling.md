## PEAR SOAP --  White Man's Burden (1899)

- colony

- racism

- white depicts the white man as clean individual or saint

- religion is depicted

- slogan "brightening the dark corners", could be a racist message

- is it really believed that black people are really black because they  need to learn to clean themselves?

- black people are not counted as civilization.

-  colonies are to be "reconditioned" and tought into the way of the west, by giving ways to the ones that they were deemed as uncivilized.

**Your new-caught sullen people, hald devil, half child**

**towards the light** -- death??

## Rudyard KIPLING:


Understanding the importance of work of kipling, is needed to understand the world where he lived in. He was born in 1865 and considered himself an Anglo-Indian (this term for those born in India during British rule).

This time of imperialsim, confusion of identity and national allegiance would become promient motifs in his poetry. During his life, the empire was unchallenged. His belief was that it was the empires' duty to act as a global law force.


"The white man's burden" is an excellent example of how Kipling takes a 
snapshot of his time and instills it into future generations.

Although many of us will find the racial prejudice repugnant, be aware that during the 19th century was considered  the social form.

>In the 19th century, the indigenous were believed to not have a soul, and to be savage beasts.

The poem may prove itself to be a perfect example for wich we can relate to the social, emotional and personal reflections of Kipling, and in the way he understand the world he lives in.

>How does a nation become an empire? By establishing a norm and dominating an area -real or abstract- where human rights are constantly broken.

>**Was he for or against the British Empire or Imperialsim?**

## The white man's burden

He wrote this poem for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and was published in 1899 in the American magazine McClure's as a response to the American controlled Philipines wich were taken after the Spanish-American War (1898).

> In 1898, Spain did not have any more colonies.

> In 1848, 7 states belonged to Mexico, but then became part of the US, and they still speak in Spanish. 

This controversial poem focuses on the debate of whether the Empire was beneficial or not. The poem was written at the beginning of the Philippine-American War and the U.S Senate ratification of the treaty that placed Puerto Rico, Guam, Cuba, and the Philippines under American control.

T.Roosevelt (soon to become Vice-president and president),copied the poem and sent it to Henry Cabot Lodge, a Senator, who commented: "rather poor poetry, but good sense from the expansion point of view".

The rationalized notion of "White man's burden" became a euphemism for imperialism and many anti-imperialists showed their opposition in reaction to the phrase.

The poem shows an exaltation of the benefits of the empire together with the dangers and costs involved. Pro imperialists in america would use the phrase as a justification for this policy as a noble enterprise.

This poem's title was embraced by the colonists in America an "The white man's burden" became a slogan to justify imperialism. It also became a common phrase in everyday use.

It appears to be a rhethorical order to white men to colonize and rule people of other nations for their own benefit. It may be said that both the title and the theme has become emblematic both Eurocentric racism and of western aspirations to dominate the world. This poem can be analyzed from different perspectives and causes different emotions.

Some academics conclude that Kipling had a very Eurocentric view of the world. The poem proposes that white people have the duty to control these beasts and savages and teach them the "proper" ethnic and cultural Western ways.

> How do we consider the other ones / the unknown ??


The term "The white man's burden" has been interpreted as a racist phrase, but it also shows the "philantrophic view" common in Europien societies where the wealthy were morally obliged to assist the less fortunate in improving life, regardless of if those helped needed or wanted it in the first place. The views of kipling in this poem absolutely explained the dominant mindset wich allowed colonialism at that time to flourish.

Another argument of Kipling's writing was satirical. The white man's burden is used as a reflection on the burden of being a white man, rather than the white man's obligation to teach those whoare not white. This interpretation is about the complexity of being white. Nevertheless, Kipling was regarded as a very pro-imperialist believer, but amazingly was not ignorant of the ugly side of imperialism.

> Is is that bad to be white?

    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    of wich stripes seem flawless,
    believe in your colours,
    strive in your search for greatness.

    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    as the anthem washes all the problems away,
    unite all beneath the same flag,
    conquer the the territory in your way.

    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    us all brothers and sisters,
    find ourselves as fighters,
    united all beneath the same flag,

    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    where the loudest cry comes with the singing,
    and the night starts dwindling,
    
    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    all colours alike, all in the same fight
    united all beneath the same flag,
    shall our dreams take flight.

    Unite all beneath the same flag,
    watch from the top the pole,
    as all of us gather creating a nation as a whole,
    united under the same flag.
